## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

Iâ€™m a backend engineer with a focus on building efficient, scalable, and well-structured RESTful APIs using Python and Flask. This space serves as a collection of my work, experiments, and ongoing learning in backend development. From handling routing and middleware to designing robust database schemas, I enjoy tackling the challenges that come with building the logic and infrastructure behind the scenes of modern applications.

My experience includes designing and implementing APIs that power web and mobile applications, managing user authentication, and ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and the database layer. I work extensively with PostgreSQL for database management, taking care to write optimized queries, design normalized schemas, and ensure data integrity across applications.

In addition to my core tech stack, Iâ€™m constantly exploring tools and practices that improve performance, maintainability, and security. Whether itâ€™s integrating third-party services, handling error logging, or writing unit tests, I believe that clean, readable code and thoughtful architecture are essential for building reliable systems.

This repository features a variety of backend-focused projectsâ€”some small and experimental, others more completeâ€”that reflect my journey as a developer. It's a space to showcase what Iâ€™ve learned, document what Iâ€™m still figuring out, and hopefully, share something useful with the community.

Feel free to explore the code, leave feedback, or fork anything that might be helpful to your own projects. Iâ€™m always open to collaboration, learning from others, and growing within the developer community.

Thanks for stopping byâ€”and stay tuned for more backend builds and improvements.
